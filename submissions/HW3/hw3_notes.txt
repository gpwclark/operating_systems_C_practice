hw3
 - make each thread do one thing!
 - tests will be much like hw1
 - how to terminate all the threads.
 - assert after every down and before it's up that the condition is true.
 - anything to assert after an up, loop invariant?
	+ include assert.h
	+ assert a boolean predicate
 - Software engineering issues - each thread is a producer and a consumer, improve this with OO style to make it modular.
 - make a buffer abstract data type, like an object. encapsulate all producer and consumer code, deposit/remoove methods.
 - main program is called homework 3, must have file buffer.c and buffer.h
 - 

Extra-credit
	- build your own semaphores. read the cods and figure out what condition variables.
